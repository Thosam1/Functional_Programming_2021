# Exercise Session 7

## Question 1

Consider the following series:

```
1
1 1
2 1
1 2 1 1
1 1 1 2 2 1
3 1 2 2 1 1
...........
```

1. Find the next element in the sequence above.

Now, let us encode an element of the sequence above as a `List[Int]`.


2. Write a function to compute the next element.

```scala
def nextLine(currentLine: List[Int]): List[Int] = ???
```

3. Implement a lazy list `funSeq` which constructs this sequence. Recall: to construct a lazy list, you can use `LazyList.cons[A](a: A, b: => LazyList[A]): LazyList[A]`

```scala
lazy val funSeq: LazyList[List[Int]] = ...
```

## Question 2

1. Write a lazy list of squares of integers â‰¥ 1. You may use `LazyList.from(i: Int)`

```scala
val squares: LazyList[Int] = ...
```

2. Write a lazy list of all non-empty strings using the characters "0" and "1" and the concatenation operation +. In other words, every non-empty string composed of "0" and "1" should be reached at some point.

```scala
val codes: LazyList[String] = ...
```

3) Using `codes`, write a lazy list of all possible non-empty palindromes of "0" and "1". You may use the `.reverse` function defined on strings.

```scala
val palCodes: LazyList[String] = ...
```

4. Can you do the same without filtering? The palindromes need not to be in the same order.

5. Given another lazy list `otherCodes`, possibly finite or infinite, you don't know at first:

```scala
val otherCodes: LazyList[String] = [some external source]
```

Build a lazy list `allCodes` that interleaves `palCodes` and `otherCodes`.
