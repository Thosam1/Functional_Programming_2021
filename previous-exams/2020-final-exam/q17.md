# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b q17 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2021/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-q17
cd cs210-q17
```

You can always refer to:
  * [the example guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md) on the development workflow.
  * [this guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/grading-and-submission.md) for details on the submission system.
  * [The documentation of the Scala standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.13.3)
  * [The documentation of the Java standard
    library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html)

**If you have issues with the IDE, try [reimporting the build](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/-/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md#ide-features-like-type-on-hover-or-go-to-definition-do-not-work), if you still have problems, use `compile` in sbt instead.**

# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise 17: For-comprehensions

You are given two classes (`Library` and `Book` which are defined below) and the method `f`, which from a given list of libraries and a list of publishers generates a list with the book count of each publisher in each library. Book count results are a triple containing the publisher, the library location, and the number of books. If a library does not contain books from a publisher then the count is not included in the result.


```scala
case class Library(books: List[Book], location: String)
case class Book(title: String, authors: List[String], publisher: String, year: Int)

def f(libraries: List[Library], publishers: List[String]): List[(String, String, Int)] = {
  for {
    publisher <- publishers
    library <- libraries
    if numBooksPublishedBy(library.books, publisher) != 0 // Don't list if there are no books in the library
  } yield (publisher, library.location, numBooksPublishedBy(library.books, publisher))
}

def numBooksPublishedBy(books: List[Book], publisher: String): Int = ...
```

Your task is to rewrite the method `f` to use `map`, `flatMap` and `withFilter` instead of the for-comprehension. The resulting method should of course have the same result as the for-comprehension above.
