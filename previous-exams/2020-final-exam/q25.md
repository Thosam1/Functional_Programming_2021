# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b q25 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2021/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-q25
cd cs210-q25
```

You can always refer to:
  * [the example guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md) on the development workflow.
  * [this guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/grading-and-submission.md) for details on the submission system.
  * [The documentation of the Scala standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.13.3)
  * [The documentation of the Java standard
    library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html)

**If you have issues with the IDE, try [reimporting the build](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/-/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md#ide-features-like-type-on-hover-or-go-to-definition-do-not-work), if you still have problems, use `compile` in sbt instead.**

# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise

Consider the infinite integer sequences `a(n)` defined by the following equations (for a given initial positive integer `k`):

```
a(0)   = k
a(n+1) = a(n) / 2       if a(n) is even (for n >= 0)
a(n+1) = 3 * a(n) + 1   if a(n) is odd  (for n >= 0)
```

Here are the first 16 numbers of that sequence for `k = 10`:

```
10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ...
```

For `k = 11`:

```
11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, ...
```

And for `k = 12`:

```
12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ...
```

As you can see, these sequences all converge to `1` and then loop with the same pattern (`1, 4, 2, 1,`).

There is a famous mathematical conjecture stating that for any initial positive integer `k` the resulting sequence always converges to `1`.

In this exercise, your task is to write a lazy list implementation of these integer sequences. Your sequences should stop when the first `1` is reached, that is:

- `(k = 10) 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`
- `(k = 11) 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`
- `(k = 12) 12, 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1`

For the purpose of this exercise, you should ignore the limitations of 32-bit integers.
