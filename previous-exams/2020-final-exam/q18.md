# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b q18 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2021/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-q18
cd cs210-q18
```

You can always refer to:
  * [the example guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md) on the development workflow.
  * [this guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/grading-and-submission.md) for details on the submission system.
  * [The documentation of the Scala standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.13.3)
  * [The documentation of the Java standard
    library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html)

**If you have issues with the IDE, try [reimporting the build](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/-/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md#ide-features-like-type-on-hover-or-go-to-definition-do-not-work), if you still have problems, use `compile` in sbt instead.**

# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise 18: For-comprehensions

You are given the class `Book` (which is defined below) and the method `f`, which from a given list of books, a predicate on years and a predicate on authors will return tuples with the author and name of the books for which the predicates hold.


```scala
case class Book(title: String, authors: List[String], year: Int)

def f(books: List[Book], yearPred: Int => Boolean, authorPred: String => Boolean): List[(String, String)] = {
  for {
    book <- books
    if yearPred(book.year)
    author <- book.authors
    if authorPred(author)
  } yield (author, book.title)
}
```

Your task is to rewrite the method `f` to use `map`, `flatMap` and `withFilter` instead of the for-comprehension. The resulting method should of course have the same result as the for-comprehension above.
