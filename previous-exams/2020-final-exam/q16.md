# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b q16 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2021/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-q16
cd cs210-q16
```

You can always refer to:
  * [the example guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md) on the development workflow.
  * [this guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/grading-and-submission.md) for details on the submission system.
  * [The documentation of the Scala standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.13.3)
  * [The documentation of the Java standard
    library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html)

**If you have issues with the IDE, try [reimporting the build](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/-/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md#ide-features-like-type-on-hover-or-go-to-definition-do-not-work), if you still have problems, use `compile` in sbt instead.**

# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise 16: For-comprehensions

You are given two classes (`Library` and `Book` which are defined below) and the method `f`, which from a given list of libraries generates a list of Scala book titles with their edition and location. Books might be in more than one location. Two editions of a book are considered distinct.


```scala
case class Library(books: List[Book], location: String)
case class Book(title: String, publisher: String, editions: List[Int])

def f(libraries: List[Library]): List[(String, Int, String)] = {
  for {
    library <- libraries
    book <- library.books
    if book.title.contains("Scala")
    if !book.title.contains("La Scala") // List books about `Scala` but not books about `La Scala` opera
    edition <- book.editions
  } yield (book.title, edition, library.location)
}
```

Your task is to rewrite the method `f` to use `map`, `flatMap` and `withFilter` instead of the for-comprehension. The resulting method should of course have the same result as the for-comprehension above.
