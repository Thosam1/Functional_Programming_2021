# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b q24 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2021/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-q24
cd cs210-q24
```

You can always refer to:
  * [the example guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md) on the development workflow.
  * [this guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/grading-and-submission.md) for details on the submission system.
  * [The documentation of the Scala standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.13.3)
  * [The documentation of the Java standard
    library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html)

**If you have issues with the IDE, try [reimporting the build](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/-/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md#ide-features-like-type-on-hover-or-go-to-definition-do-not-work), if you still have problems, use `compile` in sbt instead.**

# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise

Pell numbers are defined by the following equations:

```
a(0) = 0
a(1) = 1
a(n) = 2 * a(n - 1) + a(n - 2)  (for n > 1)
```

Here are the first 25 Pell numbers:

```
0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378, 5741, 13860, 33461, 80782, 195025, 470832, 1136689, 2744210, 6625109, 15994428, 38613965, 93222358, 225058681, 543339720
```

Implement this sequence as an infinite lazy list of integers.

There are many ways to correctly solve this problem, however some implementations run in an exponential time, so be careful, an inefficient implementation might result in a timeout during the grading process.

For the purpose of this exercise, you should ignore the limitations of 32-bit integers.
