# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b q23 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2021/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-q23
cd cs210-q23
```

You can always refer to:
  * [the example guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md) on the development workflow.
  * [this guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/grading-and-submission.md) for details on the submission system.
  * [The documentation of the Scala standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.13.3)
  * [The documentation of the Java standard
    library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html)

**If you have issues with the IDE, try [reimporting the build](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/-/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md#ide-features-like-type-on-hover-or-go-to-definition-do-not-work), if you still have problems, use `compile` in sbt instead.**

# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise

Define the sequence of all numbers divisible by 7 that read the same backward as forward:

```
7, 77, 161, 252, 343, 434, 525, 595, 616, 686, 707, 777, 868, 959, 1001, 1771, 2002, 2772, 3003, 3773, 4004, 4774, 5005, 5775, 6006, ...
```

This sequence is infinite and must be implemented as a lazy list of integers.

For the purpose of this exercise, you should ignore the limitations of 32-bit integers.
