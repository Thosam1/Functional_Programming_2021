# Setup

You can use the following commands to make a fresh clone of your repository:

```
git clone -b q22 git@gitlab.epfl.ch:lamp/students-repositories-fall-2021/cs210-GASPAR.git cs210-q22
cd cs210-q22
```

You can always refer to:
  * [the example guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md) on the development workflow.
  * [this guide](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/blob/master/labs/grading-and-submission.md) for details on the submission system.
  * [The documentation of the Scala standard library](https://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/api/2.13.3)
  * [The documentation of the Java standard
    library](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/docs/api/index.html)

**If you have issues with the IDE, try [reimporting the build](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/lamp/cs210/-/blob/master/labs/example-lab.md#ide-features-like-type-on-hover-or-go-to-definition-do-not-work), if you still have problems, use `compile` in sbt instead.**

# Be functional!

This course is about **functional** programming, therefore you're not allowed to use the following
constructs in this assignment:
- `var`
- `while`
- `return`
- Any class in the `scala.collection.mutable` package

# Exercise

Define the sequence of all numbers that read the same upside down (180Â° rotation) on a seven-segment display:

```
0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 22, 55, 69, 88, 96, 101, 111, 121, 151, 181, 202, 212, 222, 252, 282, 505, 515, 525, 555, ...
```

For reference, digits on a seven-segment display are rendered as follows:

```
 _        _    _         _    _    _    _    _
| |   |   _|   _|  |_|  |_   |_     |  |_|  |_|
|_|   |  |_    _|    |   _|  |_|    |  |_|   _|
```

This sequence is infinite and must be implemented as a lazy list of integers.

For the purpose of this exercise, you should ignore the limitations of 32-bit integers.
